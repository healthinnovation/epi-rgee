Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that facilitates access to high-performance 
computing resources for processing and analysing large geospatial datasets ([Noel Golerick et al.,2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900)).

# **Objectives:**

  - Be accessible to various professionals without being experts in handling supercomputers.
  - Reduce pre-post processing time of satellite images on a local, regional or global scale.
  - Implement application development without being a backend/frontend expert.
  - Boost the development of big data for remote sensing.
 
# **Components:**

  - **Data catalog:** Curated collection of several petabytes of geospatial datasets widely used in remote sensing available to the general public.
  - **High performance computing service:** Google's computational infrastructure to optimise parallel processing and distribution of geospatial data.
  - **API and client libraries:** Application programming interface for making requests to Earth Engine servers.
    - **API**
      - Client libraries
      - Code Editor
      - REST API
   
    - **Client libraries**:
      - JavaScript
      - Python
